# Deep Learning Book Notes

This repository contains my reading notes and attempts at implementations of 
the topics covered in the excellent book ["Deep Learning"](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, 
Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.

The goal of this repository is to provide a mix of hands-on Python examples, notes, external links, 
and practical projects as a means of study to accompany the theoretical topics outlined in the book.

I will generally use `numpy` in Jupyter notebooks to take notes, using LaTeX where it may help.

__Note__ that there are many errors in formatting and several glyphs when GitHub renders LaTeX in the embedded Jupyter notebooks here.  These should render properly locally if you clone the repositories and open them in Jupyter. I'm running the notebooks in Chrome on macOS.
