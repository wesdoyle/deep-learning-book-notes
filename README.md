# Deep Learning Book

This repository contains my reading notes and attempts at implementations of 
the topics covered in the excellent book "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, 
Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.

I will generally use `numpy` in Jupyter notebooks to take notes and provide LaTeX where it may help.
