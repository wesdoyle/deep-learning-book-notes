# Deep Learning Book Notes

This repository contains my reading notes and attempts at implementations of 
the topics covered in the excellent book ["Deep Learning"](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Ian Goodfellow, 
Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.

The goal of this repository is to provide a mix of hands-on Python examples, notes, external links, 
and practical projects as a means of study to accompany the theoretical topics outlined in the book.

I will generally use `numpy` in Jupyter notebooks to take notes, using LaTeX where it may help.
